Revision history for POE-Component-Client-SMTP

0.13    February-06-2006
    * Fixed a bug concerning the return values in case of error sending an email
        This means that ARG1 sent back when SMTP_Failure event occurs, having a
        key like OE::Wheel::* will contain a ref to an array containing the
        error received by the underlying wheel
        ( Thanks to Sergey Skvortsov for pointing me that out )
    * Added test file for checking the return when POE::Wheel::SocketFactory
        fails

0.12    November-17-2005
    * Added BindAddress and BindPort attributes that are passed to
POE::Wheel::SocketFactory when creating the socket.

0.11    November-11-2005
    * refactored the module to use Objects
    * redone the API
    * added examples
    * added BCC/CC support
    * added context support (Mike Schroeder's suggestion)
    * removed Alias as a mandatory parameter (patch from BinGOs)

0.06 - 0.10 Development or inexistent versions

0.05    June-23-2005
    * added smtp_bind_address parameter to ->send();
    it is passed to SocketFactory's constructor as BindAddress

0.04    June-20-2005
    * added a new parameter for the send() method, smtp_body instead
    of smtp_data
    * smtp_data is mutually exclusive with any parameter that may 
    alter the message's header; this means that you either send a
    simple message assembled by POE::Component::Client::SMTP using
    smtp_body or you construct the entire message elsewhere and 
    pass it to the smtp_data parameter
    * added smtp_ehlo so that the user may control what PoCoClSMTP
    sends in response of server greeting

0.03    June-06-2005/00:00
        * removed t/07-isa.t

0.02    June-02-2005/00:00
    * Output in debug mode is a little bit more readable
        * Added SMTP "Timeout" facility
        * Added tests for the module
        * "cleaned" up the module inside, meaning that most of the SMTP server
        codes have their own handler

0.01    May-23-2005/17:00
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
