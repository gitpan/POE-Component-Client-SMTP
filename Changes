Revision history for POE-Component-Client-SMTP

0.05	June-23-2005
	* added smtp_bind_address parameter to ->send();
	it is passed to SocketFactory's constructor as BindAddress

0.04	June-20-2005
	* added a new parameter for the send() method, smtp_body instead
	of smtp_data
	* smtp_data is mutually exclusive with any parameter that may 
	alter the message's header; this means that you either send a
	simple message assembled by POE::Component::Client::SMTP using
	smtp_body or you construct the entire message elsewhere and 
	pass it to the smtp_data parameter
	* added smtp_ehlo so that the user may control what PoCoClSMTP
	sends in response of server greeting

0.03    June-06-2005/00:00

0.02    June-02-2005/00:00
	* Output in debug mode is a little bit more readable
        * Added SMTP "Timeout" facility
        * Added tests for the module
        * "cleaned" up the module inside, meaning that most of the SMTP server
        codes have their own handler
