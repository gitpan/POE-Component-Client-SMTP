* add ->spawn() wrapper around ->send(), together with 'shutdown' event
this makes it possible to hold a single POE::Component::Client::SMTP
around, for sending more than one message per session;

* add an argument to the SMTPSuccessEvent that contains the message
that has been transmited; arguably useful.

* optionally set an event name that is emmited periodically by
PoCoClSMTP indicating how much of the message has been sent

* piping support thru sendmail binary

* freeze the interface

* add support for CC and BCC fields

* add (internal, POEish) MIME support

* remove tests dependency on POE::Component::Server::TCP

If you feel like needing one of these features, you may contact me.

Patches (for bugfixes or enhancements) are more than welcome.
